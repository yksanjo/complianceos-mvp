## 💡 Technical Deep-Dive

```
🧵 Why topology for fraud detection?

Traditional ML: Looks at features
Topology: Looks at structure

Persistent homology captures patterns invisible to feature-based ML.

This is why TopoGuard finds fraud others miss.

## 🔒 Privacy-First

```
🔒 Privacy-first AI: Process everything locally

✅ TinyGuardian: On-device IoT monitoring
✅ FinPrompt: Local financial queries
✅ CAPTCHA: Local challenge generation

No cloud = No breach risk.

This is what zero-trust AI looks like.
