🚨 Infrastructure for the "Death of SaaS" - Save Your SaaS from Vibe Coding
```

## Content:

The "Death of SaaS" is happening now. Customers are churning because they can "vibe code" better solutions themselves in 5 minutes.

But those vibe-coded apps lack security, compliance, and robustness. SaaS companies that don't become "Systems of Record" will die.

I built the **SaaS Extensibility Engine** - open-source infrastructure that transforms any SaaS into an extensible platform where customers can build ON your platform rather than just using it.

🔧 **What it does:**
- Converts your OpenAPI/Prisma schemas into LLM-readable capability manifests
- Provides secure sandboxed execution with row-level security
- Enables natural language → working workflow in <5 minutes
- Adds inter-agent communication and capability discovery

🎯 **Key Features:**
• **Schema-to-Agent Translator**: Auto-generates LLM tool definitions from your APIs
• **Security Sandbox**: Row-level security, scoped tokens, immutable audit logs
• **Vibe Code Runtime**: Natural language workflow generation with Monaco editor
• **Agent Protocol**: Optional inter-agent communication layer

📊 **The Numbers:**
- Increases SaaS retention from 35% → 70% by becoming a platform
- Reduces integration time from hours → minutes
- Provides enterprise-grade security for customer-built workflows
- Enables monetization through workflow marketplace

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript 5.0 + Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- JWT + encryption for security
- Optional MCP/OpenCLAW integration

This isn't just another middleware - it's survival infrastructure for SaaS companies in the age of AI. Your customers WILL build their own solutions. The question is: will they build them on your platform or abandon you?

Looking for early adopters and contributors! What features would make this essential for your SaaS?
