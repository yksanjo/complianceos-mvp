## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Delete Repos
- Archive instead
- Deleting loses history and stars
- Archiving is reversible

### ❌ Don't Use All Caps
- Looks unprofessional
- Hard to read
- Use Title Case instead

### ❌ Don't Skip Descriptions
- Empty repos look abandoned
- Descriptions help SEO
- Shows you care about presentation

### ❌ Don't Pin Forks
- Unless you've significantly improved them
- Shows original work, not curation
- Exception: forks with many contributions

---

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### 1. Consistency Over Perfection
Better to have 100 repos with "good enough" descriptions than 20 with perfect ones.

### 2. Batch Operations
Do similar tasks together:
- All descriptions at once
- All topic tags at once
- All archives at once

### 3. Use GitHub's UI Shortcuts
- Press `.` on any repo to open VS Code web
- Use "Edit" pencil for quick file edits
- Bulk edit descriptions via Settings

### 4. Mobile Check
View your profile on mobile. Does it still look good?
