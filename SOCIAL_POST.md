**Title:** I built a one-click deploy AI agent that's 99% cheaper than Claude Opus

**Post:**

**TL;DR:** Built open source AI agent platform on Cloudflare Workers. Switched from Claude Opus ($15/M tokens) to DeepSeek ($0.14/M tokens) - 99% cost reduction. One-click deploy, web chat, multiple providers.

**The Cost Problem:**
Recently paid $1 just to say "hello" to Claude Opus. At $15 per million tokens, AI costs were unsustainable for personal/side projects.

**The Solution:**
Switched to affordable providers:
- Kimi AI (Moonshot): $0.60/million tokens (96% cheaper)
- DeepSeek AI: $0.14/million tokens (99% cheaper!)

**What I Built:**
`moltworker-simplified` - A minimal AI agent platform on Cloudflare Workers:
- Single JavaScript file (~150 lines)
- Web chat interface with model selection
- Token-based authentication
- Direct API proxy to Kimi/DeepSeek
- No containers, no complex setup

**Live Demo:** https://simple-kimi-ai.yksanjo.workers.dev
